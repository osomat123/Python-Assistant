# Python-Assistant

A python based virtual assistant.

This virtual assistant can open any application that is installed on a Mac. Just type in the app you want the assistant to open and it'll be done.

For example: You can type "Hey PyAssistant, Can you run Google Chrome for me?" and the assistant will open it for you.

Don't want to write down the entire name of of an application? Just type "add nickname *nickname* for *App name*" in the given format.
For example: Type "add nickname Webex for Cisco Webex Meetings" and it'll be done!

Finally, if you want to exit just type "quit" or "bye" or "exit" or "stop" or "ciao" and it will shut down shutdown.

This application creates an *apps.json* file the first time you run it to get the paths of all the applications installed on your mac. This is done to ensure fast loading of apps for future use.
